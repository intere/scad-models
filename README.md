# SCAD Models

This repo is a collection of models that I've created using [OpenSCAD](https://www.openscad.org/).
I began building this because I wanted to build a better more robust version of a D20 Dice Box (that uses 10mm magnets to hold shut) than what I found on Thingverse.  At the time of this README, I haven't yet printed it (I'm still tweaking the model before I print it).
